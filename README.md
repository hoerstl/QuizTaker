# QuizTaker

This project implements only a single key functionality. Take a screenshot of a quiz page, feed it to gemini, and return it.

This project is intended to be used with trivia or silly questions. e.g. "Who is widely hailed as having invented the first automobile?", "What is a bicycle with one wheel called?", etc.


# Get Started
The instructions are simple:
1. Simply add your Gemini API key to a `.env` file.
2. Call the `init()` function from the module.
2. Call the `answerVisableQuizQuestion()` function in the `main.py` file.
